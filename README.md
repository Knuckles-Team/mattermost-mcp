## Overview

Mattermost MCP provides a high-performance, model-optimized interface to Mattermost capabilities. It isolates the model from underlying API transport complexity, ensuring safe, idempotent, and highly traceable system interactions.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Facade Orchestration**: Integrates multi-inheritance clients cleanly under a single facade.
- **Battle-Tested Resilience**: Out-of-the-box credential authentication, connection polling, and request retry strategies.
- **FastMCP Declarative Tools**: Fast, native schema registration with full inline validation.
- **Complete Test Intent Diversity**: Deep, automated unit, integration, and mock tests ensuring high code coverage.

## ⚙️ Dynamic Tool Selection & Visibility

This MCP server supports dynamic toolset selection and visibility filtering at runtime. This allows you to restrict the set of exposed tools in order to prevent blowing up the LLM's context window.

You can configure tool filtering via multiple input channels:

- **CLI Arguments:** Pass `--tools` or `--toolsets` (or their disabled counterparts `--disabled-tools` and `--disabled-toolsets`) during startup.
- **Environment Variables:** Define standard environment variables:
  - `MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` / `MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS`
  - `MCP_ENABLED_TAGS` / `MCP_DISABLED_TAGS`
- **HTTP SSE Request Headers:** Pass custom headers during transport initialization:
  - `x-mcp-enabled-tools` / `x-mcp-disabled-tools`
  - `x-mcp-enabled-tags` / `x-mcp-disabled-tags`
- **HTTP SSE Request Query Parameters:** Append query parameters directly to your transport connection URL:
  - `?tools=tool1,tool2`
  - `?tags=tag1`

When query strings or parameters are supplied, an LLM-free **Knowledge Graph resolution layer** (using `DynamicToolOrchestrator`) matches query intents against known tool tags, names, or descriptions, with safe fallback and automated 24-hour background cache refreshing.

## Installation

Install in editable mode directly inside your active workspace:

```bash
pip install -e .[all]
```

Or via the `uv` tool:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

You can launch the FastMCP server in stdio mode via Python module execution:

```python
import asyncio
from mattermost_mcp.mcp_server import get_mcp_instance

async def main():
    mcp = get_mcp_instance()
    # Execute stdio loop or launch server
    print("MCP Server ready.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

For direct shell launch, execute:

```bash
python -m mattermost_mcp.mcp_server
```

---

## Configuration

The package is fully configurable via the environment variables listed below:

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `MATTERMOST_URL` | Mattermost Server API v4 endpoint URL | `http://localhost:8065` | Yes |
| `MATTERMOST_TOKEN` | Personal Access Token or Bot Token | `mattermost_api_access_token` | Yes |

A local template is supplied inside [.env.example](.env.example). Copy this file as `.env` and fill out your specific service endpoint parameters before starting execution.

---

## MCP Tools

The following declarative FastMCP tools are registered and available to upstream AI agents:

| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `get_me` | Get information about the connected bot user | None |
| `get_teams` | List teams that the connected bot is a member of | None |
| `get_channels` | List channels in a team | `team_id: str` |
| `create_post` | Create a new post/message in a channel | `channel_id: str, message: str, root_id: str = None` |

See [docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md) or [docs/concepts.md](docs/concepts.md) for deeper operational examples.

---

## Architecture

This package uses the standardized Agent-Utilities dynamic facade architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User([User Agent]) --> Server[FastMCP Server]
    Server --> Facade[Api Dynamic Facade]
    Facade --> ClientBase[ApiClientBase]
    Facade --> Auth[Credentials Auth Handler]
    ClientBase --> Service([External Service API])
```

---

## Deployment

### Bare-Metal (Standard pip)
1. Set up your Python virtual environment (>= 3.10).
2. Install the package: `pip install .[all]`
3. Export credentials:
   ```bash
   export MATTERMOST_URL="http://localhost:8065"
   ```
4. Run: `python -m mattermost_mcp.mcp_server`

### Container (Docker Compose)
A standard compose structure is provided inside the `docker/` folder. Build and deploy:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up --build -d
```

### Additional Deployment Options

`mattermost-mcp` can also run as a **local container** (Docker / Podman / `uv`) or be
consumed from a **remote deployment**. The
[Deployment guide](https://knuckles-team.github.io/mattermost-mcp/deployment/) has full, copy-paste
`mcp_config.json` for all four transports — **stdio**, **streamable-http**,
**local container / uv**, and **remote URL**:

- **Local container / uv** — launch the server from `mcp_config.json` via `uvx`,
  `docker run`, or `podman run`, or point at a local streamable-http container by `url`.
- **Remote URL** — connect to a server deployed behind Caddy at
  `http://mattermost-mcp.arpa/mcp` using the `"url"` key.
